    <p>It's strange how important the dog is in art.<br>
      It can be a symbol or an inspiration.<br>
      Both are interesting to observe.

          <h3> Flemish Masterpiece Crucifixion detail </h3>
          <p>Small deatail of mid 15th century Flemish Masterpiece Crucifixion. Dogs don't just symbolize cuteness in our culture but also the fidelity. See the dog's reaction to Jesus' suffering. Barking like any other watchfull dog. It's a question why the unknown painter wanted us to think about the connection between Jesus Christ and the dog.</p>

          <h3>The Expulsion</h3>
          <i> by Charlse Degroux </i>
          <p>Small reminder from the 19th century painting, which realisticly depicts the missery of the expulsed family, that dogs are always with us. Unlike the previous post, the dog is not a symbol but complements the intention of a painter to realistically point out one of many problems of industrial society.</p>

            - Possible thoughts of Adriaen van Utrecht, while he was painting this insanely detailed still life.</p>

          <h3> Breton Girl Spinning </h3>
          <i> by Paul Gauguin </i>
          <p>Key and eccentric figure of post-impressionism movement attempted to create a community of similarly thinking artists in Bretagne. During his stay, he was asked to decorate the interior of the inn in La Pouldu. <br>
            Although Gauguin inspired himself with local folclore, his fantastic mind led him to such an original depiction of late 19th century Bretagne, which composes not only a local maid but also a little dog. Does this little good boy possess any special meaning in the picture?</p>
